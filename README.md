# Skull-to-Face-Recognition

This repository is an approach to matching digital faces with a 3D model of the skull. It is based on the paper [Learning A Shared Transform Model for Skull to Digital Face Image Matching](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.04571.pdf) by Maneet Singh.

This proposal has been realized with Python and using a DataSet of 3D Skulls of each image.
